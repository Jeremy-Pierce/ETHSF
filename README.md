# Acely
Acely is a Education & Community platform that rewards its users for their positive contribution to the platform. Its unique voting structure and Tokenomics paired with existing blockchains differentiate Acely from any other platform. Users can vote/rate content and choose how many tokens they want to stake; based on how beneficial others found their contribution they receive a portion back through staked rewards.

# Tokenomics
Acely's token is a deflationairy token, where a percentage of the inflation goes towards a rewards pool to reward contributors.
Upon initial account creation users are awarded tokens that they can immediately use to spend/stake on the platform. By requiring users log in through Worldcoin, this ensures only one account per person. Preventing duplicate accounts and sybil attacks.
70% of Inflation goes towards reward pools to fund contributors
15% to stakeholders
15% to Acely DAO (for improvements to the platform)
Content creators are awarded Tokens based on our unique voting/rating which is built to help promote engagement and growth on the platform. Depending on a total percentage of users who found that content beneficial and the contents overall rating, content creators will be awarded tokens, and compete in a leaderboard for recognition and awards.
Users can stake a portion of their tokens on courses they enjoy or want to share with others, based on how much the user stakes and how many additional users found their recomendation useful, users will receive tokens back. Additionally, users can earn tokens by asking/answering questions, commments, participating in discussions, and based on how many users found their content useful they are awarded tokens.
