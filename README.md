# Acely
Acely is a Education & Community platform that rewards its users for their positive contribution to the platform. Its unique voting structure and Tokenomics paired with existing blockchains differentiate Acely from any other platform.

These NFT certificates are more than just proof of completion, by using Unlock protocol we are able to use NFT's to gain access to select communities, unlock subscription content, and much more.
